# Let's create your first viral project. 

Sharing your projects on platforms like Reddit, HackerNews, and creating a refined GitHub repository is a really hard skill. Your first ship might not be perfect, but you'll learn a TON from doing it.

There's lots of different reasons that we ship projects. You feel motivated when your project picks up traction, you get lots of really valuable feedback, you get cool oppurtunities, and so much more.

First let's look at some examples of well shipped projects on various platforms:
- [Cyao's Icepi Zero (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44115853)
- [My 3D printer motherboard (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1p9ubtu/i_designed_my_own_3d_printer_motherboard/)
- [Alex's biblically accurate keyboard (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mf0fmm/the_biblically_accurate_keyboard/)

These shipped projects all share a couple things in common:
- They have a refined GitHub repository that includes everything people want to know about your project and how to build it
- They all had a brief/moderate technical writeup of how they designed and built their projects
- They're high quality and have lots of really important small details

## Part 1 - Making a high quality GitHub repository

If you've submitted your hardware project to get a grant for a program like Highway, blueprint, etc, chances are that you already have a pretty nice repository!

But... now that you've finished building your project and ready to ship, you need to make a couple adjustements to your project.

The first thing is to start off your readme with a big photo of your actual, real life project. You don't need a professional camera or anything like that, but just take it in some decent lighting with a phone and a decent backdrop.

You'll also want to make sure that your readme and folder structure is well organized and professional looking. I personally like to organize my readme's as:
- Project name with a nice and large photo with a short summary
- Key/custom Features
- PCB/CAD design from your editor, renders work well too
- Bill of materials if you want, keep it short though
- Licenses/contact/credits at the bottom

Try to keep all your images to the same aspect ratio/size so that they fill your readme really nicely; make sure your readme isn't too long too. Here's some nice community made GitHub repositories:
- [Nathan's custom hotplate](https://github.com/notaroomba/ember) try to keep it a bit shorter, but the format is lovely!
- [DoNotDelta RAHHH](https://github.com/programmerturtle/donotdelta)
- [stm32pe midi controller](https://github.com/udu3324/stm32pe-midi)

At the end of the day, my biggest tips are to keep it moderately short, keep it moreso technical, have nice images with the same aspect ratio and keep your repo structure clean :D 

## Part 2 - Creating a High Quality/Technical Writeup

Nearly any project you're going to ship should have a writeup that details the creation of your project. There's some exceptions like visual and less-technical projects like the [biblically accurate keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mf0fmm/the_biblically_accurate_keyboard/), but I would always suggest detailing your entire process, creating your project. 

So let's look at the key details of what makes a good technical writeup. I would actually suggest changing your writeup depending on the platform you're sharing your project on. 

On hacker news, or more technical communities, you should go in-depth about the technicalities but on less-technical/more casual places like Reddit, you want to tailor your writeup more to the community you're posting in. 

So if you're posting in r/embedded, you can write more technically about a project, while in r/mechanicalkeyboards, you can write less, and talk less about the PCB, and more about the specific switches, maybe case, etc.

So how should we lay out a simple writeup. There's no fixed way of doing this, but here's a simple framework:
- Start with why you decided to create it
- Then do a short summary of the project you actually created, I prefer to talk about my projects pretty technically
- Talk a little bit about what you learned making it
- Next, talk about what you're using it or are going to use it for
- Finally make sure you link your GitHub repository and maybe talk about something you want to make next

I find my favorite writeups on hacker news, so if you want any inspiration, feel free to look at [other projects](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) on there, or a couple of the writeups that the communities made:
- [My 3D printer motherboard HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46174949)
- [Max's Tiny4fsk HN writeup](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44734983) 
- [Cyao's Icepi SBC writeup](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46376006)

My biggest tip is to constantly re-read what you've writted until you think you're done. It'll help you catch mistakes, improve clarity, and will give your post a higher chance of succeeding.

Another really important tip I've learned while shipping specifically on hacker news is to submit to the [second chance pool](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26998308). If your ship post doesn't initially hit it off, It'll basically put your project on the front page for a short amount of time and kickstart it again. Just don't abuse it and get us in trouble ;)
