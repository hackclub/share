# Let's create your first viral project. 

Sharing your projects on platforms like Reddit, HackerNews, and creating a refined GitHub repository is a really hard skill. Your first ship might not be perfect, but you'll learn a TON from doing it.

There's lots of different reasons that we ship projects. You feel motivated when your project picks up traction, you get lots of really valuable feedback, you get cool oppurtunities, and so much more.

First let's look at some examples of well shipped projects on various platforms:
- [Cyao's IcePi Zero (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44115853)
- [My 3D printer motherboard (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1p9ubtu/i_designed_my_own_3d_printer_motherboard/)
- [Max's Tiny4fsk (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44734983)

These shipped projects all share a couple things in common:
- They all had a brief/moderate technical writeup of how they designed and built their projects
- They have a refined GitHub repository that includes everything people want to know about your project and how to build it
- They're high quality and have lots of really important small details

## Part 1 - Creating a High Quality/Technical Writeup

Nearly all the projects you want to ship should have a writeup that details the creation of your project. There's some exceptions like visual and less-technical projects like the [biblically accurate keyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mf0fmm/the_biblically_accurate_keyboard/), but I would always suggest detailing your entire process, creating your project. 

So let's look at the key details of what makes a good technical writeup. I would actually suggest changing your writeup depending on the platform you're sharing your project on. 

On hacker news, or more technical communities, you should go in-depth about the technicalities but on less-technical/more casual places like Reddit, you want to tailor your writeup more to the community you're posting in. 

So if you're posting in r/embedded, you can write more technically about a project, while in r/mechanicalkeyboards, you can write less, and talk less about the PCB, and more about the specific switches, maybe case, etc.
