# Let's create your first viral project. 

Sharing your projects on platforms like Reddit, HackerNews, and creating a refined GitHub repository is a really hard skill. Your first ship might not be perfect, but you'll learn a TON from doing it.

There's lots of different reasons that we ship projects. You feel motivated when your project picks up traction, you get lots of really valuable feedback, you get cool oppurtunities, and so much more.

First let's look at some examples of well shipped projects on various platforms:
